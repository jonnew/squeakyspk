CLASSIFICATION HAS 5 POPULATED CLASSES   (max global influence value = 2.451) 

  We give below a heuristic measure of class strength: the approximate
  geometric mean probability for instances belonging to each class,
  computed from the class parameters and statistics.  This approximates
  the contribution made, by any one instance "belonging" to the class,
  to the log probability of the data set w.r.t. the classification.  It
  thus provides a heuristic measure of how strongly each class predicts
  "its" instances.

CLASS DIVERGENCES

  The class divergence, or cross entropy w.r.t. the single class
  classification, is a measure of how strongly the class probability
  distribution  function differs from that of the database as a whole. 
  It is zero for identical distributions, going infinite when two
  discrete distributions place probability 1 on differing values of the
  same attribute.

ORDERED LIST OF NORMALIZED ATTRIBUTE INFLUENCE VALUES SUMMED OVER ALL CLASSES

  This gives a rough heuristic measure of relative influence of each
  attribute in differentiating the classes from the overall data set.
  Note that "influence values" are only computable with respect to the
  model terms.  When multiple attributes are modeled by a single
  dependent term (e.g. multi_normal_cn), the term influence value is
  distributed equally over the modeled attributes.

CLASS LISTINGS:

  These listings are ordered by class weight --
    * j is the zero-based class index,
    * k is the zero-based attribute index, and
    * l is the zero-based discrete attribute instance index.

  Within each class, the covariant and independent model terms are ordered
  by their term influence value I-jk.

  Covariant attributes and discrete attribute instance values are both
  ordered by their significance value.  Significance values are computed
  with respect to a single class classification, using the divergence from
  it, abs( log( Prob-jkl / Prob-*kl)), for discrete attributes and the
  relative separation from it, abs( Mean-jk - Mean-*k) / StDev-jk, for
  numerical valued attributes.  For the SNcm model, the value line is
  followed by the probabilities that the value is known, for that class
  and for the single class classification.

  Entries are attribute type dependent, and the corresponding headers are
  reproduced with each class.  In these --
    * num/t denotes model term number,
    * num/a denotes attribute number,
    * t     denotes attribute type,
    * mtt   denotes model term type, and
    * I-jk  denotes the term influence value for attribute k
            in class j.  This is the cross entropy or
            Kullback-Leibler distance between the class and
            full database probability distributions (see
            interpretation-c.text).
    * Mean  StDev
      -jk   -jk    The estimated mean and standard deviation
                   for attribute k in class j.
    * |Mean-jk -   The absolute difference between the
       Mean-*k|/   two means, scaled w.r.t. the class
       StDev-jk    standard deviation, to get a measure
                   of the distance between the attribute
                   means in the class and full data.
    * Mean  StDev  The estimated mean and standard
      -*k   -*k    deviation for attribute k when the
                   model is applied to the data set
                   as a whole.
    * Prob-jk is known  1.00e+00   Prob-*k is  known  9.98e-01
            The SNcm model allows for the possibility that data
            values are unknown, and models this with a discrete
            known/unknown probability.  The gaussian normal for
            known values is then conditional on the known
            probability.   In this instance, we have a class
            where all values are known, as opposed to a database
            where only 99.8% of values are known.
